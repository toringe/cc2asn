# Security Policy

This is not a product or software on a regular release cadence, but primarily
a code repository for the services I run on cc2asn.com. That said, I'm truly
greatful for any feedback on security related issues or concerns. 

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Best way of reporting a security issue is to create a new issue here on github.
That provides transparency and I will be notified directly.
